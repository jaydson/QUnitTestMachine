QUnit Test Machine is a library based on QUnit to simplify Javascript tests.
With this library is possible run tests in various javascript files dinamically.
A simple API is provided, and  the developer just need to specify which files need to be tested.
Sure that you must create your tests files before start, the ideia is just simplify the way to run tests with Qunit.
